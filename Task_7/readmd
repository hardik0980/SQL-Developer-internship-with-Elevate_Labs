SQL Task 7 â€“ Views and Virtual Tables
This SQL script introduces the use of views in SQL to simplify data querying and reporting, based on the customers and orders tables in the task5_db database.

ðŸ§± Key Concepts Covered:
Creating Views

view_customer_orders: Displays a combined view of customer and order details.

view_total_spent: Shows total spending (SUM(amount)) per customer.

view_high_value_orders: Filters and shows only those orders where the amount is greater than 2500.

Using Views

Queries are performed on views to extract meaningful insights in a simplified way.

Updating Views

Demonstrates how to modify (REPLACE) an existing view (view_total_spent) to include additional fields like city.

Deleting Views

Shows how to drop a view safely using DROP VIEW IF EXISTS.

ðŸ’¡ Purpose:
To understand how views can encapsulate complex queries and make repeated data access easier, cleaner, and more efficient â€” especially for reporting or dashboard integration.
