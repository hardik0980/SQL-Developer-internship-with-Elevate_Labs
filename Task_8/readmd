SQL Task 8 – Stored Procedures and Functions
This script demonstrates how to create and use stored procedures and user-defined functions in the task5_db database, based on the customers and orders tables.

⚙️ Key Components:
Stored Procedure: get_orders_by_customer

Accepts a customer ID and returns a list of that customer’s orders.

Stored Procedure: insert_new_customer

Takes name and city as input, and inserts a new record into the customers table.

Function: get_total_spent

A reusable function that returns the total amount spent by a customer, given their ID.

Uses IFNULL() to handle customers with no orders.

Execution Examples

Calls each procedure and function with sample input to test their behavior.

💡 Purpose:
To practice writing and executing modular SQL code using procedures and functions, which help automate and encapsulate repeated logic for cleaner database operations.
